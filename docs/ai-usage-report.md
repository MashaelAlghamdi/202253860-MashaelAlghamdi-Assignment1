# AI Usage Report

## 1. AI Tools Used

- ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

## 2. How AI Was Used (Use Cases)

AI was used for debugging JavaScript logic, explaining CSS specificity, and refining documentation. It was used as a support tool during the development of this project. 

The tools were used as follows:

- **ChatGPT** – Used for explaining JavaScript logic (dark mode with localStorage), clarifying CSS specificity behavior, suggesting layout improvements, debugging, and refining documentation wording.

- **GitHub Copilot** – Used for suggesting syntax improvements, completing repetitive code patterns, and assisting with small JavaScript and CSS snippets.

ChatGPT was primarily used for conceptual clarification and debugging discussions, while GitHub Copilot supported real-time coding inside the editor through the auto-completion.

## 3. Benefits of Using AI

Using AI helped with:

- Faster development and problem-solving.
- Understanding how certain CSS properties work.
- Learning how to implement dark mode with localStorage.
- Improving the clarity of documentation.

## 4. Challenges and Limitations

Some AI suggestions required modification to better match the desired design.  
In certain cases, styling suggestions needed adjustment to maintain consistency with the project’s color theme.

AI-generated explanations were reviewed to ensure full understanding before implementation.

## 5. Learning Outcomes

Through using AI in this project, I learned:


- How to implement a theme toggle using JavaScript by dynamically adding and removing a CSS class from the `<body>` element.
- Why `localStorage` works for theme persistence: it stores key-value data directly in the browser, allowing the selected theme ("dark" or "light") to remain saved even after refreshing or reopening the page.
- How CSS overrides base styles in dark mode: when the `dark` class is added to the `<body>`, more specific selectors (e.g., `body.dark .navbar`) take priority over the default styles due to higher specificity.
- How to structure responsive layouts using Flexbox and media queries.
- The importance of reviewing, modifying, and fully understanding AI-generated code before integrating it into a project.

## 6. Responsible Use and Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed and adjusted.  
The final code reflects personal understanding and modifications.  
AI was used as a learning assistant rather than a direct copied solution.


## 7. Innovative Use of AI

AI was used beyond basic code generation. It supported decision-making by comparing different layout strategies. Multiple styling variations were tested based on AI suggestions before selecting the final design. AI also enhanced workflow efficiency by assisting with debugging and conceptual clarification, allowing more time to focus on user experience and responsiveness improvements.
