## 2. How AI Was Used (Use Cases)

AI was used as a support tool during the development of this project. It assisted with:

- Generating initial layout structure ideas.
- Suggesting improvements to CSS styling.
- Debugging layout and dark mode issues.
- Refining the wording of the portfolio description.
- Structuring documentation content.

AI was used as a helper to improve understanding and efficiency.

## 3. Benefits of Using AI

Using AI helped with:

- Faster development and problem-solving.
- Understanding how certain CSS properties work.
- Learning how to implement dark mode with `localStorage`.
- Improving the clarity of documentation.

## 4. Challenges and Limitations

Some AI suggestions required modification to better match the desired design.  
In certain cases, styling suggestions needed adjustment to maintain consistency with the project’s color theme.

AI-generated explanations were reviewed to ensure full understanding before implementation.

## 5. Learning Outcomes

Through using AI in this project, I learned:


- How to implement a theme toggle using JavaScript by dynamically adding and removing a CSS class from the `<body>` element.
- Why `localStorage` works for theme persistence: it stores key-value data directly in the browser, allowing the selected theme ("dark" or "light") to remain saved even after refreshing or reopening the page.
- How CSS overrides base styles in dark mode: when the `dark` class is added to the `<body>`, more specific selectors (e.g., `body.dark .navbar`) take priority over the default styles due to higher specificity.
- How to structure responsive layouts using Flexbox and media queries.
- The importance of reviewing, modifying, and fully understanding AI-generated code before integrating it into a project.

## 6. Responsible Use and Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed and adjusted.  
The final code reflects personal understanding and modifications.  
AI was used as a learning assistant rather than a direct copy-paste solution.
